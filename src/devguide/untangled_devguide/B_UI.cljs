  # UI

  NOTE - Namespace aliases used in this document:

```clojure
(require '[om.next :as om :refer-macros [defui]]
         '[om.dom :as dom])
```

  Om uses <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">React</a> underneath.
  The primary mechanism for creating components is the `defui` macro:"
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source Widget)
  "This macro generates a React class as a plain JavaScript class, so it is completely compatible with the
  React ecosystem.

  Notice the use of `Object`. It indicates that the following method bodies (like in <a
  href=\"http://clojure.org/reference/protocols\" target=\"_blank\">protocols</a>) are being added to the
  generated class. From an OO perspective, this is like saying \"my widget extends Object\". The `render`
  method is the only method you need, but you can also add in your own methods or React lifecycle
  methods.

  NOTE - When implementing the render function, the last top level element will be returned.

  ```clojure
  (render [this]
    (dom/div ...)  ;; <- This will not be returned.
    (dom/div ...)) ;; <- This will.
  ```

  So make sure that you only have one top level element per component

  In the author's opinion the render method should be a pure function whenever possible (avoiding component
  local state). Making your rendering pure means that if you ever feel the need to write
  tests around how the UI works (say, for acceptance testing) then you can do so very easily. The lack
  of local state means that the code tends to be so simple as to avoid most of the bugs that plague other
  frameworks.

  ## React lifecycle methods

  If you wish to provide <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html#lifecycle-methods\"
  target=\"_blank\">lifecycle methods</a>, you can define them under the Object section of the UI:
  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source WidgetWithHook)
  "
  ## ClojureScript and React â€“ HTML differences

  Here are some common things you'll want to know how to do that are different when rendering with Om/ClojureScript:

  - Inline styles are specified with real maps `(dom/p #js { :style {:backgroundColor \"rgb(120,33,41)\"} } ...)`.
    - The reader tag `#js`, tell the reader to turn the following map into a js object.
    - `dom/p` is a macro for generating p tags for use in React componenets. Refer to om for docs.
    - There are alternatives to this ([sablono](https://github.com/r0man/sablono) is popular), however we will use `om.dom`
  - Attributes follow the react naming conventions for [Tags and Attributes](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tags-and-attributes.html)
    - As an example - CSS class names are specified with `:className` instead of `:class`.
  - Any time there are adjacent elements of the same type in the DOM, they should each have a unique `:key`
  attribute. This is typically generated by a function you supply to the Om factory function, but you can
  also do it manually.

  ## Element factory

  In order to render components on the screen you need an element factory.
  You generate a factory with `om/factory`, which will then
  act like a new 'tag' for your DOM:"

  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source widget)

  "Since they are plain React components you can render them in a <a href=\"https://github.com/bhauman/devcards#devcards\"
  target=\"_blank\">devcard</a>, which makes fine tuning them as pure UI dead simple:

  ```
  (defcard widget-card (widget {}))
  ```

  The resulting card looks like this:"
  )

(defcard widget-card (widget {}))

(defcard-doc
  "Such components are known as \"stateless components\" in Om because they do not expliticly ask for data. Later,
  when we learn about colocated queries, you'll see it is possible for a component to ask for the data it needs in
  a declarative fashion.

  For now, understand that you can give data to a stateless component via a simple edn map, and pull them out of
  `this` using `om/props`:"
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source WidgetWithProperties)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source prop-widget)
  "
  ```
  (defcard props-card (prop-widget {:name \"Sam\"}))
  ```
  ")

(defcard props-card (prop-widget {:name "Sam"}))

(defui Person
  Object
  (render [this]
    (let [{:keys [name]} (om/props this)]
      (dom/li nil name))))

(def person (om/factory Person {:keyfn :name}))

(defui PeopleList
  Object
  (render [this]
    (let [people (om/props this)]
      (dom/ul nil (map person people)))))

(def people-list (om/factory PeopleList))

(defui Root
  Object
  (render [this]
    (let [{:keys [people number]} (om/props this)]
      (dom/div nil
               (dom/span nil (str "My lucky number is " number " and I have the following friends:"))
               (people-list people)))))

(def root (om/factory Root))

(defcard-doc
  "
  ## Composing the UI

  Composing these is pretty straightforward: pull out the bits from props, and pass them on to subcomponents.
  "
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source Person)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source PeopleList)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source Root)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source people-list)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source person)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source root)
  "

  ```
  (defcard root-render (root {:number 52 :people [{:name \"Sam\"} {:name \"Joe\"}]}))
  ```

  It is important to note that _this is exactly how the composition of UI components always happens_, independent of
  whether or not you use the rest of the features of Om. A root component calls the factory functions of subcomponents
  with an edn map as the first argument. That map is accessed using `om/props` on `this` within the subcomponent. Data
  is passed from component to component through `props`.

  ### Don't forget the React DOM key!

  You might notice something new here: the `om/factory` function is supplied with an additional map `{:keyfn :name}`.
  The factory function can be optionally supplied with two keywords: `:keyfn` and `:validator`. `:keyfn` produces the
  <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html\" target=\"_blank\">React key property</a>
  from component props (here it's `:name`), while `:validator` takes a function that asserts the validity of the props received.

  The key is critical, as it helps React figure out the DOM diff. If you see warning about elements missing
  keys (or having the same key) it means you have adjacent elements in the DOM of the same type, and React cannot
  figure out what to do to make sure they are properly updated.

  ## Play with it

  At this point (if you have not already) you should play with the code in `B-UI.cljs`. Search for `root-render`
  and then scan backwards to the source. You should try adding an object to the properties (another person),
  and also try playing with editing/adding to the DOM.

                                  " and I have the following friends:"))

  ## Out-of-band data: Callbacks and such

  In plain React, you store component local state and pass data from the parent to the child through props.
  Om is no different, though component-local state is a matter of much debate since you get many advantages from
  having a stateless UI. In React, you also pass your callbacks through props. In Om, we need a slight variation of
  this.

  In Om, a component can have a [query](http://localhost:3449/index.html#!/untangled_devguide.D_Queries) that asks
  the underlying system for data. If you complect callbacks and such with this queried data then you run into trouble.
  So, in general *props have to do with passing data that the component **requested in a query***.

  As such, Om has an additional mechanism for passing things that were not specifically asked for in a query: Computed
  properties.

  For your Om UI to function properly you must attach computed properties to props via the helper function `om/computed`.
  The child can look for these computed properties using `get-computed`.

  ## Component state

  Before we move on to the next section, we should consider component state in a broader scope. Most often,
  State for a component comes from passed in props. However, you may have an animation that requires no props.
  It will still contains some kind of state, but that state is considered component local state.

  Both component local state and props have a place in the picture, and it is important to understand the
  distinction. Props, as Om next and Untangled uses them, are global state, held in a single location.
  Component local state is encapsulated within a component. Mutating component local state will force a
  rerender of that component, much like mutation of props will rerender coorelating components. However,
  component local state needs to be used in moderation to avoid unintended bugs/features in your application.
  Component local state is harder to reason about when debugging and building an application. That state is
  also less useful to the entire application, as it cannot be used for a support viewer, which depends on
  global app state. As you will see later in the guide, global app state can be combined with queries,
  which will boost local reasoning (which may be why you want component local state), without creating
  stateful components that are hard to reason about in a broader application.


  ## Stateful components

  Earlier we stress that your components should be stateless whenever possible. There are a few
  notable exceptions that we have found useful (or even necessary):

  - The Untangled support viewer shows each app state change. User input (each letter they type) can
  be quite tedious to watch in a support viewer. Moving these kinds of interstitial form interactions
  into local state causes little harm, and greatly enhances support. Om automatically hooks up local
  state to input fields.
  - External library integration. We use stateful components to make things like D3 visualizations.
  This approach is also useful when integrating with complex libriaries like CKEditor.

  Components may be stateless because they do not need props passed to them (an animation that needs no external input).


  ### Form inputs

  Om already hooks local state to form elements (see [om.dom](https://github.com/omcljs/om/blob/master/src/main/om/dom.cljs))
  So, in fact, you have to override this to *not* use component local state. For text controls we'd
 recommend you leave it this way. For other controls like checkboxes it is probably best to override this.

  ### Using local state

  Using local state is useful in a few cases.  However, it should likely be your last option. If you should need
  to use it, it is rather simple, and om provides nice methods for accessing and setting the local state of a
  component. The `initLocalState` method should return a map, of values. You can access those values via
  `om/get-state`, `om/set-state!`, and `om/update-state!`"

  ### External library state (a D3 example)

  Say you want to draw something with D3. D3 has its own DOM diffing algorithms, and you want to
  make sure React doesn't muck with the DOM. The following component demonstrates how you would go about it.

  First, the actual rendering code that expects the component and the props (which have to
  be converted to JS data types to work. See further D3 tutorials on the web):
  "

  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source render-squares)

  "And the component itself:"

  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source D3Thing)
  (dc/mkdn-pprint-source d3-thing)

  "Here it is integrated into a dev card with some controls to manipulate the data:")


(defn random-square []
  {
   :id    (rand-int 10000000)
   :x     (rand-int 900)
   :y     (rand-int 900)
   :size  (+ 50 (rand-int 300))
   :color (case (rand-int 5)
            0 "yellow"
            1 "green"
            2 "orange"
            3 "blue"
            4 "black")})

(defn add-square [state] (swap! state update :squares conj (random-square)))

(defcard sample-d3-component
         (fn [state-atom _]
           (dom/div nil
                    (dom/button #js {:onClick #(add-square state-atom)} "Add Random Square")
                    (dom/button #js {:onClick #(reset! state-atom {:squares []})} "Clear")
                    (dom/br nil)
                    (dom/br nil)
                    (d3-thing @state-atom)))
         {:squares []}
         {:inspect-data true})

(defcard-doc
  "

  The things to note for this stateful example are:

  - We override the React lifecycle method `shouldComponentUpdate` to return false, so that React doesn't try to mess with
  the DOM created by D3.
  - We override `componentWillReceiveProps` and `componentDidMount` to do the actual D3 render/update. Our render method
  is idempotent, and figures out the actions to take via D3 mechanisms.

  ## Important notes and further reading

  - Remember to use `#js` to transform attribute maps for passing to DOM elements.
  - Use *cljs* maps as input to your own Elements: `(my-ui-thing {:a 1})` and `(dom/div #js { :data-x 1 } ...)`.
  - Extract properties with `om/props`. This is the same for stateful (with queries) or stateless components.
  - Add parent-generated things (like callbacks) using `om/computed` and pull them from the component with
    `(om/get-computed (om/props this)`.
